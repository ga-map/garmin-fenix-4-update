Methods for Updating the Garmin Fenix 3
=======================================

There are two supported methods to update the Garmin Fenix 3:

1. Using Garmin Express with a USB cable and computer
2. Using Garmin Connect Mobile via Bluetooth

Both methods are effective, and your choice depends on your preferences and equipment.

Method One: Updating via Garmin Express
=======================================

Garmin Express is a free application for Windows and macOS that allows users to manage and update Garmin devices.

What you need:

- A Windows or macOS computer
- A USB data cable compatible with the Garmin Fenix 3
- Garmin Express installed on your computer
- Internet access

Steps:

1. Ensure your Fenix 3 has at least a 50 percent battery charge.
2. Connect the watch to your computer using the USB cable.
3. Open Garmin Express. If you do not have it installed, download and install it.
4. When Garmin Express detects the device, select “Add a Device” if prompted.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to register and sync the Fenix 3.
6. Garmin Express will automatically check for available software updates.
7. If an update is available, a prompt will appear. Click “Install.”
8. Wait for the update to download and transfer to the watch. Do not disconnect the device during this process.
9. Once the update is transferred, eject the device safely from the computer.
10. Disconnect the USB cable. The watch will install the update and restart.

After the update, the device will return to normal operation. In some cases, the GPS module or sensors may recalibrate during the next activity.

Method Two: Updating via Garmin Connect Mobile
==============================================

Garmin Connect Mobile is a smartphone application used for syncing activities and settings with your Garmin device. It also supports wireless firmware updates for compatible devices such as the Fenix 3.

What you need:

- A compatible smartphone with Garmin Connect Mobile installed

- A registered Garmin account

Steps:

1. Turn on Bluetooth on your smartphone and Fenix 3.
2. Open the Garmin Connect Mobile app.
3. Ensure the Fenix 3 is paired with the app and syncing correctly.
4. Garmin Connect will check for updates in the background during sync.
5. If an update is available, it will begin downloading to your phone and transferring to the watch via Bluetooth.
6. Keep the watch near the phone and ensure that the connection is not interrupted.
7. Once the update transfer is complete, your Fenix 3 will prompt you to install it.
8. Accept the prompt and allow the device to restart and install the update.

Note that Bluetooth transfer may be slower than USB, so this method can take longer.

Checking Your Software Version
==============================

To verify whether your Fenix 3 is up to date, you can check the current version of the software installed on the device.

Steps:

1. Press and hold the “Up” button to open the menu.
2. Scroll to “Settings.”
3. Select “System,” then go to “About.”
4. Here, you will see the current Software Version, Unit ID, and other device information.

Compare this software version to the one shown in Garmin Express to determine whether an update is necessary.

Best Practices Before and After Updating
========================================

- Always charge the Fenix 3 before starting the update.
- Avoid using third-party USB cables that may not support data transfer.
- Never disconnect the device during update installation.
- After updating, restart the device and sync it with Garmin Connect to ensure all settings and activity data are preserved.
- Occasionally perform a hard reboot (holding the Light button until the device restarts) after an update for smoother performance.

Troubleshooting Common Update Problems
